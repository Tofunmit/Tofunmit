Projects I have developed so far: These projects are in private repositories due to some sensitive information used in the creation, development and deployment of the application(s).

- E-Learnize
E-Learnize is an online learning platform built using Angular, TypeScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. Users can register as a learner or instructor to take or teach courses across various subjects.

This project was built as part of my master's program to demonstrate full-stack web development skills. Implementing video conferencing using the Zoom API was a particular highlight.
